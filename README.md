# ieeg-python-project-template
Template repository for Python projects that use iEEG. Requires downloading the ieegpy repository and adding it to the python path (follow ieegpy README instructions). This repository consists of scripts that pull data from iEEG and generate a simple plot. Both are found in code/tools, and an example use case is given.
